Quiz Three - Reviewing what we know

1. Why might a developer choose to use a remote API rather than storing all data locally? List two advantages.

2. Imagine you’re building a weather app.
Which HTTP method would you use to:
a) Show the current weather in Sydney?
b) Save a user’s favorite cities to their account?
c) Update their preferred temperature unit (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)?
d) Remove a saved city from their list?

3. You send a GET request to an API and receive a 500 error. What does this status code mean, and what might be causing it?

4. Suppose an API does not follow REST principles.
What potential problems could arise when building a large-scale app with it?

5. You’re using a remote API for translating words, but it limits you to 100 requests per day. What’s one strategy you could use to stay within that limit?

6. Explain the difference between this pair of endpoints:

a) GET /users/5
b) GET /users

What kind of data would each return?

7. A RESTful API is said to be “stateless.” What are two real-world benefits of this design choice for developers and users?

8. Think of an everyday app on your phone. Can you describe how it might use an API behind the scenes, even if you don’t see it directly?
